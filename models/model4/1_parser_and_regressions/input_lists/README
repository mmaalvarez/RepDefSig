all coordinates hg19

dna repair: 
			OGG1 (3 samples with increasing damage time)
			BPDE (2 reps)
			UV
				XR-seq	NHF1, CSB, and XPC cell lines
						CPD or 6-4PP damage
						~2 reps each
						at 1h
				tXR-seq	GM12878 cell line
						CPD damage
						2 reps
						at 4h
			XRCC4
			BRCA2 (using what I think is the fold enrich between BRCA and input)


samples: Nik-Zainal iPSCs (induced pluripotential stem cells)

		/g/strcombio/fsupek_cancer3/malvarez/WGS_tumors/somatic_variation/cell_lines/kucab_2019
	
		- Only including the controls, and the treated samples whose mutation burden is above the mean mut burden of the controls (done in kucab_2019/processed/list_treated_samples_mutburden_above_mean_of_controls.R)


chromatin feature: replication time pooled8

offset: log(N trinuc) of each RT bin and N(C/T)N combination (6 Ã— 32 = 192)
