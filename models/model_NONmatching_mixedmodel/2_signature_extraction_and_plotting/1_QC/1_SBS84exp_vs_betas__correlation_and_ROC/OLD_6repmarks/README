for the analysis with
	- AIDvsbgGenome only (i.e. not including 6 DNArep marks in the formula)
	- no 50bp flanks around AID off-target regions
	- levels ref:bgGenome vs. alt:AID_target (coeffs. positive for AID-SHM), while now ref-alt are inverted (thus now AID-SHM coeffs are negative)
	- no controls
		- NOW non-lymphoid samples (no prediction) --> in these the exposure to SBS84 shouldn't explain the mutation burden (esp. in AID targets) â€“ assume same off-target regions


WARNING: ROC and mann-whitney are worse now



Mann whitney and AUROC:
	
	- "Predictor":	sample's SBS84 exposure (calculated with Maia's code in /g/strcombio/fsupek_cancer3/malvarez/WGS_tumors/somatic_variation/TCGA_PCAWG_Hartwig_CPTAC_POG_MMRFCOMMPASS/AID_SHM/)

				vs.

	- "Response":	sample's label, either "non-AID-SHM" or "AID SHM" if:

															estimate's lower CI95% > 0
																			&
															estimate > median(estimates of all samples)
