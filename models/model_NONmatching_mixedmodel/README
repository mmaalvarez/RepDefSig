kucab + zou + lymphoid samples (PCAWG+TCGA+Hartwig)
	
	include nonlymphoid for AID exploratory plot (mutburden~SBS84)


Repliseq + AIDtargets-vs-bgGenome(50bp flanks) + dna rep variables--> UV (2) + SETD2 + MSH6 + XRCC4

	Not using OGG1 nor TP53 since they have huge gaps and I lose 1000's SNVs per sample

	NO windows around nothing (only AID offtargets):

		- repmarks: gaps between ranges are so big that this shouldn't make a difference, and it takes ages to add them

		- nor SNVs


masked low mappability regions for SNV coordinates (i.e. kept those in CRG75)
