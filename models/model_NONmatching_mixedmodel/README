kucab + zou + lymphoid samples (PCAWG+TCGA+Hartwig)
	
	include nonlymphoid for AID exploratory plot (mutburden~SBS84)


AIDtargets-vs-bgGenome(50bp flanks) + the 7 dna rep variables + tp53

	windows around repmarks, not around SNVs


DID NOT mask low mappability regions for SNV coordinates: too many SNVs lost
