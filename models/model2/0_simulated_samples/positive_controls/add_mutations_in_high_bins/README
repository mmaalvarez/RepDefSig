- For each DNA repair pathway (e.g. MMR):

	- 1st) calculate the mutation burden baseline (=="baseline sample"): mean # mutations (treating each of the 96 trinuc types separately, to keep relative %s thereof) across ALL samples that DO NOT have (apparent) MMRdef, WITHIN each of the 2 genome BINS (i.e. high/low abundance)
	
	- 2nd) each simulated sample will be the "baseline sample" + an increased # mutations (×2, ×3, ×4…), but ONLY in the genome bin with 'high' activity of a mark for that repair (e.g. high MSH6)
	
		- again, each trinuc type treated independently to keep the relative trinuc %s

- All the simulated samples will be then run together with real ones in the NMF/VAE

- The simulated samples should have high exposures of the signatures with high weights for the expected mark (e.g. for "MMRdef simulated samples", high "MSH6-weight signature exposure")

	- the more sensitive the model, low mut. burden-increase (e.g. ×2?) simulated samples should already show high exposures
