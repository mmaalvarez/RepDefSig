scale coefficients to [-1,1] within each table (the original, or each permutation) within each DNA repair mark across all samples
in permuted table, shuffle all rows


sample names must be in the first column

And all other columns must be the numerical features

sample_short	feature_1	feature_2	any_name
sample1	-4	3.4	4
any_name	4	3.2	0
