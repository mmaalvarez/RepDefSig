dna repair: OGG1 (many -pseudo-reps), BPDE (2 reps), XRCC4, BRCA2 (using what I think is the fold enrich between BRCA and input)


samples: Nik-Zainal iPSCs (induced pluripotential stem cells)

chromatin feature: replication time pooled8

	maybe better ENCODE's RepTime for the embryonic stem cell line BG02 (as iPSCs are de-differentiated cells that are therefore similar to embryonic stem cells)?
