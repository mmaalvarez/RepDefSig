dna repair: 
			OGG1 (3 samples with increasing damage time)
			BPDE (2 reps)
			UV
				XR-seq	NHF1, CSB, and XPC cell lines
						CPD or 6-4PP damage
						~2 reps each
						at 1h
				tXR-seq	GM12878 cell line
						CPD damage
						2 reps
						at 4h
			XRCC4
			BRCA2 (using what I think is the fold enrich between BRCA and input)


samples: Nik-Zainal iPSCs (induced pluripotential stem cells)

chromatin feature: replication time pooled8

	maybe better ENCODE's RepTime for the embryonic stem cell line BG02 (as iPSCs are de-differentiated cells that are therefore similar to embryonic stem cells)?
