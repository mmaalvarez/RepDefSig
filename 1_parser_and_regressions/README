- each model (combination of chromatin features, DNA repair markers, etc) has a separate folder


- sample_ids.tsv is from 
	/g/strcombio/fsupek_cancer3/malvarez/WGS_tumors/somatic_variation/TCGA_PCAWG_Hartwig_CPTAC_POG_MMRFCOMMPASS/metadata/comb_metadata_final_6datasets__noconsent_samples_removed__hartwig_upd.tsv
	
	- split of samples by n of SNVs (which increases memory usage a lot) in 
		/g/strcombio/fsupek_cancer3/malvarez/WGS_tumors/somatic_variation/TCGA_PCAWG_Hartwig_CPTAC_POG_MMRFCOMMPASS/metadata/bin_samples_by_nrows/
		
	
- chromatin maps from

 /g/strcombio/fsupek_cancer3/malvarez/chromatin_info/
													histone_methylation_and_DHS/
													DNA_methylation/
													replication_time/
													rna_seq/
													copy_number/
	- NOTE: probably will just use Replication time

			name in chromatin_features.tsv has to match the column name of the feature abundance in its chipseq file, e.g. 'RepliSeq', no 'RepliSeq_6bins'


- bound protein abundance maps from
													bound_protein_abundance/
																			208_proteins_ENCODE/	(CTCF, BRCA1)
																			CTCFmotif_and_cohesin/
																			laminb1/

- DNA repair activity marks from
																			DNA_repair/
																						BER/
																						NER/	Here the 2 reps BPDE_tXRseq_rep[1,2]_2strands have conflicting strands, I'm just setting them to '*'
																						MMR/
																						DSB/



results.tsv is the metadata file merged with the reg coefficients and pvalues from the regression of each sample
